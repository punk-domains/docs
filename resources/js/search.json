In that case also check whether the contract has a function called setBaseURI(or similar) in the Write section. This would allow the NFT project creator to change the IPFS URL and change your metadata (like change the NFT name or image).","Image","Name","Obviously it's best if metadata is stored on-chain, which means it lives there forever and no one can change it.","Often NFT creators reserve the right to change the IPFS base URL in their NFT contracts, which means they can change the metadata for your NFT and potentially even steal it (the token ID would remain the same, but data such as name, image, attributes etc. would be completely different). In that case an IPFS storage is no better than a centralized server.","On a centralized server.","On a decentralized storage system such as IPFS and Arweave.","On-chain(on the blockchain where NFT exists, usually in the same smart contract).","Somewhere in the middle is hosting metadata on IPFS or Arweave. In that case it's important that the web3 domain service is paying for the constant availability of the metadata. If it's not, the metadata can be inaccessible for certain periods of time or even disappear from the system completely (if no IPFS node is incentivized to keep that data, why should they?)","That's why keeping all data completely on-chain is extremely important and this is what Punk Domains does.","The easiest way is to go to the NFT contract on Etherscan (or similar block explorer) and find the Read section. This section includes all functions that help you read data stored in a smart contract.","The metadata can be stored on three different places:","The NFT metadata usually include the following data:","The worst storage for metadata is a centralized server, because the owner of that server can change the data or even delete it completely. It can also happen that the server malfunctions and is not available for some time, or that hard drive gets corrupted and there's no backup (the data is lost forever).","Then find a function called tokenURI and enter some random token ID in it (for example: 1).

Such data can include things like a homepage URL, Twitter handle, email, phone number, profile picture etc. Adding this additional data is completely optional.","Storing other data on-chain may not be that important as it is for storing metadata and domain name, but it's still better than being stored off-chain."]},{"l":"Users have complete control over their domain names","p":["This is another thing that seems to go without saying, but not all \"web3\" domain services follow that approach.

Factories, of course, are not allowed to create new TLDs with the same name (hence, the \"forbidden TLDs list\").","The Forbidden TLDs list does not include only TLDs from the Punk Domains ecosystem, but also TLDs created by other protocols such as .eth by ENS, and TLDs owned by Unstoppable Domains."]},{"l":"The Resolver contract","p":["Resolving a domain means querying an address (and other data) associated with this domain. There's also a reverse process (called reverse-resolver) where you try to find domain(s) associated with an address.","Each TLD contract has a resolver and a reverse-resolver implemented by default, as methods in the TLD contract itself.","But because there are so many TLD contracts, it's also good to have a single smart contract that can resolve all TLDs on the given chain. This contract is called PunkResolver, and is not crucial for the system to work, but it is a nice shortcut.","Instead of having to find and/or store all TLD contract addresses, you just need to know one contract address (the resolver's address) and always resolve domains through that contract."]}],[{"l":"How to contribute to Punk Domains","p":["As you already know, Punk Domains is a web3 domains protocol that can issue domain extensions for DAOs and other web3 communities.","Some of the protocol clients include renowned names such as KlimaDAO (.klima domain extension), Layer2DAO (.L2), Smol Brains NFT community (.smol), PoolTogether (.pool), etc.","As it's common with open-source software, Punk Domains protocol is developed and maintained by contributors."]},{"l":"What is a contributor","p":["A contributor is a volunteer that uses their time and skills to benefit the project.
